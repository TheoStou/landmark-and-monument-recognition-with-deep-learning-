# Landmark and Monument Recognition with Deep Learning
(Train a custom model based on the monuments of the UNESCO Monuments Route of Thessaloniki with Tensorflow Object Detection API and deploy it into Android.)

In this project, we provided an approach to constructing and implementing a Monument/Landmark object detection model based on Convolution Neural Networks. Gathering a sufficient number of images for the [UNESCO World Heritage Monuments of Thessaloniki](https://thessaloniki.travel/en/exploring-the-city/themed-routes/unesco-monuments-route) and using the SSD MobileNet V1 and V2 models from [TensorFlow 1 Detection Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md), we were able to successfully train and apply them in an Android application, capable of conducting a real-time object detection. </br>

## Approach

### 1. Preparing the dataset
Probably the most time-consuming part of the experiment consisted of the data gathering and the pre-processing. An essential and inextricable task for every training model in machine learning is the collection of the required dataset (collection of data).


#### A. Data Gathering

#### B. Data pre-processing

### 2. Google Colaboratory
